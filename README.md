This is a template project for building games and apps using [Corona SDK](http://www.coronalabs.com)

This project was originally corona-game-template. Because it is generic enough to be used for business apps too, it has been renamed to Corona Application Template, or CAT for short, a.k.a. Muning. Muning is a common Filipino name for a cat.

# Usage

Out of the box, this is a working Corona project. It includes a splash screen (loadmenu.lua) which displays images/splash_screen.png for 1 second and then displays the main menu (menu.lua) with the following buttons:
- Start
- Settings
- Help
- About

Note the naming convention for button images:
The buttons for Play are btn_play.png and btn_play_over.png; the buttons for Settings are btn_settings.png and btn_settings_over.png, etc.

If you have Ruby 1.9.3 installed, my Ruby gem [nakor](http://github.com/radamanthus/nakor) provides an easy command-line interface to generating apps from this template.
